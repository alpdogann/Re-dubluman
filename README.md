# Re-Dubl端man

This project was born out of my desire to make the vocals in the songs of the famous Turkish music group Dedubl端man more audible. My goal is to make the vocals in the songs more clearly heard. For this reason, I named the project 'Re-Dubl端man'

### About Project
Re-Dubl端man is a tool that separates vocals and other instruments in music tracks. This tool uses a sound separation model called Demucs to separate the audio sources, and then allows you to make separate volume adjustments for vocals and other sounds. The project is hosted on [Streamlit](https://re-dubluman.streamlit.app), enabling users to upload audio files and process them instantly
